Conclusions: 

1. Capomulin is overall a very effective drug regimen-looking at average tumor volume across all mice across the timepoints (2nd to last graph), there is a clear, consistent, and sharp reduction in tumor volume over time.
2. This study's subjects are about 50:50 male:female mice, which is good experimental design to make sure gender does not have an undue effect on the outcome of the data.
3. The boxplot (3rd from the bottom) also proves the effectiveness of Capomulin, as well as Ramicane-the 2 most effective treatments that have the lowest average final tumor volume across all mice.
